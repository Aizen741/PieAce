<b> Design Engineering Project (3rd Year)</b>

Health is a really important factor in anyone's life. PieAce is a pedometer app . In todays world alot of health related app is availabe . But PieAce is new in the game. As we as an Engineer build PiezoElectric tiles along with the app. The Idea is Inspired from games. Just think about it , most of the world's top games are Role-playing Games. So, what if we make an app which make you a character in real world.
  
  Lets go into future for a moment. Let's say 10 years . Imagine every part of city have tracks made of PiezoTiles Available and you woke up and as a game character have Tasks and missions assigned to you in an app. You have to go for a Run or Walk and cover that much footsteps to unlock a new level and get Points. These new points will work as coupons. If Government approve this project, then imagine the amount of value you earn through coupon is used to give discount from your Electricity bill. Isn't it Exciting? 
  
This App still in its Early phase . But the vision for this Idea is bright.
